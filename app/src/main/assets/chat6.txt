The weather is getting so cold. I really hate it!
I do too. I miss the fall already. September was really lovely here. I wish we could have that weather all year.
Don’t say that. I don’t want the Earth to get any warmer. One of my classes yesterday got me freaked out about global warming.
More freaked out than usual?
I think we’re all concerned about global warming. What was different about yesterday’s class?
We started studying the melting permafrost in the Arctic.
The Earth has to get a lot warmer for the permafrost to melt, right?
No, and the scariest part is the feedback loop.
The feedback loop? What’s that?
Well, there’s carbon frozen in the permafrost, right? And when the permafrost melts, microbes release carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more climate change.
What’s the loop part?
We all know that carbon dioxide and methane cause global temperatures to rise.
And if the temperature rises, then more permafrost melts.
Exactly. And when more permafrost melts, more carbon dioxide and methane is released. That causes global temperatures to rise even more. And the cycle continues.
That is one scary cycle. What can we do to stop it?
Reduce our carbon dioxide emissions. For most people this means using less energy, using cleaner energy like solar and wind, and driving less.
