Hello Mrs Adams.
Please tell me how do I get to your house?
Are will you coming by car, bus  or by train?
I will be coming by car.
Please could you tell me the easiest way of getting to your house?
Take the M6 to London and need to come of at junction 78
London, could you spell that for me
London
Thanks
OK, then turn right at the roundabout and take the second right my house is on the left next to the local pet store.
Is that the quickest way of getting to your house?
Yes, it is the quickest way by car.
Would it be possible for you draw me a map please, as  I do not know the area very well as I am from Blackburn.
Yes I will draw a map and send you a copy in an email with some directions we have just talked about.
Thank you so much.
You are welcome.
