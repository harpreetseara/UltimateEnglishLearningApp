Hello, would you organize me a taxi for tomorrow afternoon?
That will be no problem. Where do you want the taxi to take you?
Well, I have to be at a business conference for 2 o clock at the Regents hotel. I'm hoping that it is not very far away from here.
No. It’s only a twenty minute drive from this hotel and your will be fine as the traffic is very quite at that time.
Then one thirty will be fine. No! make it one fifteen to be on the safe side. Book the taxi for 1-15 in the afternoon, please.
OK. I will make booking right away for you.
Thank you for your help. And please tell the taxi company  to make sure the taxi arrives by 1-15, as that will leave me plenty of time.
Would you like me to order a taxi for when you return?
That's a great idea. Could make sure the taxi waiting for me outside for 8 o clock
Don’t worry, we’ll take care of that.
